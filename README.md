# LTA Score

<div align="center">

*A platform for the League of Legends fan community in Brazil to rate professional players from LTA South and LTA North*
</div>

## 📌 Overview

**LTA Score** is an Android application that connects esports fans to the competitive League of Legends scene in the LTA South (formerly CBLOL) and LTA North (formerly LCS) leagues. The platform allows the community to express their appreciation for professional players through a continuous rating system based on their performances in official matches.

Created by fans and for fans, LTA Score does not intend to be an alternative classification system to official rankings, but rather a way to engage the community in constructive discussions about the performance of professional players and celebrate great plays.
